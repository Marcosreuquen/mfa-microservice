# Installation

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/marcosreuquen/mfa-microservice.git`

Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the server: `fastapi run app/main.py`

# Uso

Update the environment variables in `.env` file with the values in the `.env.example` file.

Create a virtual environment:
```python3 -m venv .venv```

Activate the virtual environment: ```source .venv/bin/activate```

You will need a database to run the server, or it will fail. If you don't have a database, you can use a local Postgres instance or run a docker container.
``` docker run -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password postgres```

Run the server: ```uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000``` or ```fastapi dev app/main.py```

Then you can use swagger-ui in http://localhost:8000/docs to access the API documentation.
